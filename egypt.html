					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
						fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It
						is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8
						million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the
						Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the
						Greater Cairo metropolis.
					</p>
					<p>
						Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site
						of the some of the most imporessive and ancient monuments in the
						world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the
						necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most
						famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the
						Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the plateau
						have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
						quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with
						amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with
						the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the
						attention of less prominent officals of lower rank. These
						officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into
						burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the
						original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found
						available space. This resulted ina number of grave complexes
						throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings
						who built the famous pyramids which, thorughout history, have
						drawn vistors from around the world.
					</p>

				<section id="pyramids">
					<h2>Pyramids</h2>
					<p>
						Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the pyramids
						of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early as the
						First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king Djet which
						was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at least one
						king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has also been
						found. Further, inscriptions relate how king Khufu had to clear many
						earlier tombs and grave complexes to build the Great Pyramid. What
						happened to the corpses or the grave goods from those tombs is not
						known.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the pyramid of Cheops, the
						king's Greek name) is the last remaining of the ancient Seven Wonders
						of the World and rises to a height of 481 feet (147 metres). The
						pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144 metres) and that of Menkaure
						rises to 213 feet (65 metres). The Great Sphinx sits on the eastern
						side of the plateau apart from the pyramids but it is thought it once
						was an important part of the pyramid complex which covered the area.
						The head of the Sphinx is believed by Egyptologists to be that of the
						king Khafre though others contend that represents Khufu. Further on,
						the great solar barge of Khufu, which is the oldest intact ship
						extant, was found buried in a pit near the Great Pyramid in 1954 CE.
						Dating from c.2500 BCE, the ship is 143 feet (43 metres) long and 19
						feet (5.9 metres) wide. Near the Pyramid complex there are a number of
						smaller structures known as the Queens Pyramids. It is uncertain who
						was buried beneath these pyramids but evidence suggests they were the
						tombs of Hetepheres I (Khufu's mother), Meretites (Khufu's wife) and a
						later queen named Henutsen.
					</p>
					<p>
						The pyramids were once encased in polished limestone which, according
						to ancient writers, reflected the light of the sun brilliantly. The
						limestone was stripped away over the years for use in other building
						projects, most notably the mosques of Cairo. Of the three major
						pyramids, however, only Menkaure's is seen today without any of its
						original limestone casing; Khafre's Pyramid retains its casing stones
						at its apex while Khufu's has a smaller remainder at its base. The
						sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were oriented astronomically
						to be precisely north-south and east-west within a small fraction of a
						degree.

					<h2>Tombs</h2>
					<p>
						The original layout of the necropolis at Giza seems to have been very
						precise and well-ordered but, after the end of the Old Kingdom, other
						tombs were dug without regard for the original pattern. Sometimes they
						were dug above existing tombs, making present-day Giza a wealth of
						archaeological material. Recent excavations have uncovered tombs of
						high officials, magistrates, and supervisors of building projects, as
						well as monuments honoring the Egyptian workers who labored on the
						pyramids and others who were employed and lived in the immediate
						vicinity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Largely due to engravings and etchings from the 19th century and early
						20th centuries CE (and postcards and calendars of modern times) many
						people think of the Giza plateau and the pyramids as resting in a
						remote, wind-swept desert locale, when in reality it sits at the very
						edge of urban sprawl of Cairo today. In its time it would have also
						been a center of daily activity with many buildings, colonnades,
						terraces and shops. The image of the Giza plateau in the modern day is
						thus vastly different from how it looked during the Fourth Dynasty of
						Egypt when the pyramids were built. There was a worker's village,
						which has been discovered and excavated, around 1300 feet (400 meters)
						south of the Great Sphinx where the laborers who worked on Menkaure's
						pyramid lived and those who built Khufu's pyramid founded a small
						village (Khufu's Village) on the far side of the complex.

					<h2>Climate</h2>
					<p>
						Giza experiences a hot desert climate like arid climate (Köppen: BWh).
						Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Wind storms
						can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the
						city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter
						range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to
						below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the
						lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow
						and freezing temperatures are extremely rare.
					</p>
					<p>
						Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F)
						on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36
						°F) on 8 January 1966

					<h2>Abandonment and Discovery</h2>
					<p>
						During the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2040 BCE) Giza was
						abandoned and fell into decay during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040-1782
						BCE). The tombs, including the pyramids, were broken into and robbed
						and kings of the Middle Kingdom tore down temples, broke up walkways,
						and removed statuary for use in their own building projects. The
						pharaohs of the New Kingdom (1570-1069 BCE) reversed this policy and
						dedicated themselves to preservation efforts.
					</p>
					<p>
						Rameses II (1279-1213 BCE) was especially interested in Giza and had a
						small temple built there in front of the Sphinx. It was Rameses fourth
						son Khaemweset, however, who worked the hardest to preserve the site.
						Khaemweset never ruled Egypt but was a crown prince whose efforts to
						restore the monuments of the past are well documented. In fact, he is
						considered today the world's "first Egyptologist" for his work in
						restoration, preservation, and recording of ancient monuments.
						Khaemweset brought the Giza plateau back to life and it continued to
						be used as a necropolis by the following dynasties, with less and less
						frequency, until Egypt was taken over by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Giza plateau was more or less neglected - except by tourists,
						those dismantling the structures for their own uses, and grave robbers
						- until Napolean's Egyptian Campaign of 1798-1801 CE. Napolean had
						brought along a team of scientists, artists, and engineers who he set
						to work investigating and recording facts about the Giza monuments and
						others throughout Egypt. Napolean's work there attracted others to
						Egypt and archaeologists, adventure-seekers, entrepreneurs, and
						scholars began traveling to Egypt to investigate these monuments for
						themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Among the most famous of these was Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie
						(1853-1942 CE) whose work is still considered the most important
						contribution to Egyptology and who brought the Great Pyramid to world
						attention. It is because of the work of men like Flinders Petrie that
						on-going preservation, restoration, and archaeological work has
						continued almost non-stop from the 19th century CE to the present. The
						Giza plateau is one of the world's most popular tourist attractions
						and continues to draw visitors from around the world daily.
