              Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
              fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It
              is the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8
              million as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the
              Nile, 4.9 km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the
              Greater Cairo metropolis.

              Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza Plateau, the site
              of the some of the most imporessive and ancient monuments in the
              world.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo which served as the
              necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Most
              famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560 BCE) and the
              Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the plateau
              have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
              quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with
              amazing precision and skill but, once it became associated with
              the great kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the
              attention of less prominent officals of lower rank. These
              officials had enough money and prestige to buy their way into
              burial plots at Giza but had no regard for the symmetry of the
              original schematics and had their tombs dug wherever they found
              available space. This resulted ina number of grave complexes
              throughout Giza which would not have been authorized by the kings
              who built the famous pyramids which, thorughout history, have
              drawn vistors from around the world.

            Although the Giza plateau is most closely associated with the pyramids
            of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the site was used as early as the
            First Dynasty of Egypt as evidenced by the tomb of the king Djet which
            was found toward the edge of the plateau. Evidence of at least one
            king from the Second Dynasty (Nynetjer) buried at Giza has also been
            found. Further, inscriptions relate how king Khufu had to clear many
            earlier tombs and grave complexes to build the Great Pyramid. What
            happened to the corpses or the grave goods from those tombs is not
            known.
          </p> <br/>
          <p>
            The Great Pyramid of Khufu (also known as the pyramid of Cheops, the
            king's Greek name) is the last remaining of the ancient Seven Wonders
            of the World and rises to a height of 481 feet (147 metres). The
            pyramid of Khafre is 471 feet tall(144 metres) and that of Menkaure
            rises to 213 feet (65 metres). The Great Sphinx sits on the eastern
            side of the plateau apart from the pyramids but it is thought it once
            was an important part of the pyramid complex which covered the area.
            The head of the Sphinx is believed by Egyptologists to be that of the
            king Khafre though others contend that represents Khufu. Further on,
            the great solar barge of Khufu, which is the oldest intact ship
            extant, was found buried in a pit near the Great Pyramid in 1954 CE.
            Dating from c.2500 BCE, the ship is 143 feet (43 metres) long and 19
            feet (5.9 metres) wide. Near the Pyramid complex there are a number of
            smaller structures known as the Queens Pyramids. It is uncertain who
            was buried beneath these pyramids but evidence suggests they were the
            tombs of Hetepheres I (Khufu's mother), Meretites (Khufu's wife) and a
            later queen named Henutsen.
          </p> <br/>
          <p>
            The pyramids were once encased in polished limestone which, according
            to ancient writers, reflected the light of the sun brilliantly. The
            limestone was stripped away over the years for use in other building
            projects, most notably the mosques of Cairo. Of the three major
            pyramids, however, only Menkaure's is seen today without any of its
            original limestone casing; Khafre's Pyramid retains its casing stones
            at its apex while Khufu's has a smaller remainder at its base. The
            sides of all three of the Giza pyramids were oriented astronomically
            to be precisely north-south and east-west within a small fraction of a
            degree.

            The original layout of the necropolis at Giza seems to have been very
            precise and well-ordered but, after the end of the Old Kingdom, other
            tombs were dug without regard for the original pattern. Sometimes they
            were dug above existing tombs, making present-day Giza a wealth of
            archaeological material. Recent excavations have uncovered tombs of
            high officials, magistrates, and supervisors of building projects, as
            well as monuments honoring the Egyptian workers who labored on the
            pyramids and others who were employed and lived in the immediate
            vicinity.

            Largely due to engravings and etchings from the 19th century and early
            20th centuries CE (and postcards and calendars of modern times) many
            people think of the Giza plateau and the pyramids as resting in a
            remote, wind-swept desert locale, when in reality it sits at the very
            edge of urban sprawl of Cairo today. In its time it would have also
            been a center of daily activity with many buildings, colonnades,
            terraces and shops. The image of the Giza plateau in the modern day is
            thus vastly different from how it looked during the Fourth Dynasty of
            Egypt when the pyramids were built. There was a worker's village,
            which has been discovered and excavated, around 1300 feet (400 meters)
            south of the Great Sphinx where the laborers who worked on Menkaure's
            pyramid lived and those who built Khufu's pyramid founded a small
            village (Khufu's Village) on the far side of the complex.

            Giza experiences a hot desert climate like arid climate (Köppen: BWh).
            Its climate is similar to Cairo, owing to its proximity. Wind storms
            can be frequent across Egypt in spring, bringing Saharan dust into the
            city during the months of March and April. High temperatures in winter
            range from 16 to 20 °C (61 to 68 °F), while nighttime lows drop to
            below 7 °C (45 °F). In summer, the highs are 40 °C (104 °F), and the
            lows can drop to about 20 °C (68 °F). Rain is infrequent in Giza; snow
            and freezing temperatures are extremely rare.

            Up to August 2013, the highest recorded temperature was 46 °C (115 °F)
            on 13 June 1965, while the lowest recorded temperature was 2 °C (36
            °F) on 8 January 1966

            During the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181-2040 BCE) Giza was
            abandoned and fell into decay during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040-1782
            BCE). The tombs, including the pyramids, were broken into and robbed
            and kings of the Middle Kingdom tore down temples, broke up walkways,
            and removed statuary for use in their own building projects. The
            pharaohs of the New Kingdom (1570-1069 BCE) reversed this policy and
            dedicated themselves to preservation efforts.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Rameses II (1279-1213 BCE) was especially interested in Giza and had a
            small temple built there in front of the Sphinx. It was Rameses fourth
            son Khaemweset, however, who worked the hardest to preserve the site.
            Khaemweset never ruled Egypt but was a crown prince whose efforts to
            restore the monuments of the past are well documented. In fact, he is
            considered today the world's "first Egyptologist" for his work in
            restoration, preservation, and recording of ancient monuments.
            Khaemweset brought the Giza plateau back to life and it continued to
            be used as a necropolis by the following dynasties, with less and less
            frequency, until Egypt was taken over by the Roman Empire in 30 BCE.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            The Giza plateau was more or less neglected - except by tourists,
            those dismantling the structures for their own uses, and grave robbers
            - until Napolean's Egyptian Campaign of 1798-1801 CE. Napolean had
            brought along a team of scientists, artists, and engineers who he set
            to work investigating and recording facts about the Giza monuments and
            others throughout Egypt. Napolean's work there attracted others to
            Egypt and archaeologists, adventure-seekers, entrepreneurs, and
            scholars began traveling to Egypt to investigate these monuments for
            themselves.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            Among the most famous of these was Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie
            (1853-1942 CE) whose work is still considered the most important
            contribution to Egyptology and who brought the Great Pyramid to world
            attention. It is because of the work of men like Flinders Petrie that
            on-going preservation, restoration, and archaeological work has
            continued almost non-stop from the 19th century CE to the present. The
            Giza plateau is one of the world's most popular tourist attractions
            and continues to draw visitors from around the world daily.
